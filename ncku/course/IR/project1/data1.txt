The autosomal dominant form of polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most frequent monogenic disorders and the most frequent among inherited kidney disorders.
In fact it has a prevalence in the population of about 1/1,000 individuals, therefore it does not even satisfy the definition for rare diseases.
It is mainly characterized by the formation of multiple cysts filled with fluid that over time develop in number and size leading to the distraction of the structure and function of the kidneys and eventually leading to chronic kidney disease/end stage kidney disease (CKD/ESKD), usually between the 4th and 7th decade of life.
There are two known forms of the autosomal dominant type of polycystic kidney disease, type 1 and type 2, caused by mutations in the PKD1 and PKD2 genes, located on chromosomes 16 and 4 respectively.
The polycystin 1 protein, encoded by PKD1 and mutated in ~85% of patients, is a huge protein of 4,302 amino acids with multiple transmembrane domains, 200 residues intracytoplasmic part and a huge extracellular part with multiple Ig-like PKD repeats, which probably acts as a receptor to an unknown ligand.
Polycystin 1 has been shown to interact with and participate in multiple signal transduction pathways, including the G-protein coupled receptor, cAMP pathway, Wnt, mTOR, MAPK/ERK, AP1 and JAK-STAT pathway, while its intracytoplasmic C-terminal domain has been shown to be cleaved and translocated to the nucleus where it plays a role in gene transcription, in concert with P100 and STAT6.(1.)
--------------------
Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have high cardiovascular mortality and morbidity and a high risk for developing malignancy.
Excessive oxidative stress is thought to play a major role in elevating these risks by increasing oxidative nucleic acid damage.
Oxidative stress results from an imbalance between reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RONS) production and antioxidant defense mechanisms and can cause vascular and tissue injuries as well as nucleic acid damage in CKD patients.
The increased production of RONS, impaired nonenzymatic or enzymatic antioxidant defense mechanisms, and other risk factors including gene polymorphisms, uremic toxins (indoxyl sulfate), deficiency of arylesterase/paraoxonase, hyperhomocysteinemia, dialysis-associated membrane bioincompatibility, and endotoxin in patients with CKD can inhibit normal cell function by damaging cell lipids, arachidonic acid derivatives, carbohydrates, proteins, amino acids, and nucleic acids.
Several clinical biomarkers and techniques have been used to detect the antioxidant status and oxidative stress/oxidative nucleic acid damage associated with long-term complications such as inflammation, atherosclerosis, amyloidosis, and malignancy in CKD patients.
Antioxidant therapies have been studied to reduce the oxidative stress and nucleic acid oxidation in patients with CKD, including alpha-tocopherol, N-acetylcysteine, ascorbic acid, glutathione, folic acid, bardoxolone methyl, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and providing better dialysis strategies.
This paper provides an overview of radical production, antioxidant defence, pathogenesis and biomarkers of oxidative stress in patients with CKD, and possible antioxidant therapies.
