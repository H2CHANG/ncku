Netrin-1 regulates cell survival and apoptosis by activation of its receptors,
including UNC5B. However, the in vivo role of UNC5B in cell survival during
cellular stress and tissue injury is unknown. We investigated the role of UNC5B
in cell survival in response to stress using mice heterozygously expressing the
UNC5B gene (UNC5B(-/flox)) and mice with targeted homozygous deletion of UNC5B in
kidney epithelial cells (UNC5B(-/flox/GGT-cre)). Mice were subjected to two
different models of organ injury: ischemia reperfusion injury of the kidney and
cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. Both mouse models of UNC5B depletion had normal
organ function and histology under basal conditions. After AKI, however,
UNC5B(-/flox/GGT-cre) mice exhibited significantly worse renal function and
damage, increased tubular apoptosis, enhanced p53 activation, and exacerbated
inflammation compared with UNC5B(-/flox) and wild-type mice. shRNA-mediated
suppression of UNC5B expression in cultured tubular epithelial cells exacerbated 
cisplatin-induced cell death in a p53-dependent manner and blunted Akt
phosphorylation. Inhibition of PI3 kinase similarly exacerbated cisplatin-induced
apoptosis; in contrast, overexpression of UNC5B reduced cisplatin-induced
apoptosis in these cells. Taken together, these results show that the netrin-1
receptor UNC5B plays a critical role in cell survival and kidney injury through
Akt-mediated inactivation of p53 in response to stress.
